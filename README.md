# Pong
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side.


Steps:
1. Create the screen
2. Create and move a paddle
3. Create another paddle
4. Create the ball and make it move constantly across the screen
5. Detect when the ball collides with wall and make it bounce back
6. Detect when there's a collision with the paddle to know when to bounce it back
7. Count the score when the ball misses the paddle
